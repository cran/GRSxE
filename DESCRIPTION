Description: Statistical testing procedures for detecting
  GxE (gene-environment) interactions. The main focus lies on
  GRSxE interaction tests that aim at detecting GxE interactions
  through GRS (genetic risk scores). Moreover, a novel testing
  procedure based on bagging and OOB predictions is implemented
  for incorporating all available observations at both GRS
  construction and GxE testing.
