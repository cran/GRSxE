Description: Statistical testing procedures for detecting
  GxE (gene-environment) interactions. The main focus lies on
  GRSxE interaction tests that aim at detecting GxE interactions
  through GRS (genetic risk scores). Moreover, a novel testing
  procedure based on bagging and OOB (out-of-bag) predictions is
  implemented for incorporating all available observations at
  both GRS construction and GxE testing (Lau et al., 2023,
  <doi:10.1038/s41598-023-28172-4>).
